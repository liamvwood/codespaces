# Session Review — Agent Experience Improvements (2026-02-21)
**Session ID:** 6128822e-5adb-41d9-a81b-99bea462d18c
**Duration:** 2026-02-21T19:53:58Z → ongoing
**CWD:** /workspaces/codespaces

## Summary
Meta-improvement session: reviewed the previous session, created a plan for improving the
Copilot CLI agent experience, and implemented 4 custom agents (`resume-editor`,
`application-tracker`, `cover-letter-writer`, `recruiter`), 3 skills (`compile-resume`,
`tracker-stats`, `scrape-jobs`), a `sessionStart` hook with a stats dashboard, and improved
custom instructions with TDD workflow and token economy sections. Caught and fixed agent/skill
file format bugs by consulting live docs.

---

## What Went Well
- Plan mode used correctly before implementation — produced a clear, structured plan
- Docs consulted for correct file formats (`.agent.md`, `SKILL.md` in subdirectories) rather
  than guessing — caught real bugs before they would have caused silent failures
- Parallel file creation used for agents and skills — efficient
- `recruiter` agent added on user request without needing to re-explain context
- Hook implementation correct on first try; script tested locally before committing
- All changes committed with meaningful messages

---

## Instruction Gaps → Fixes

| Gap | Recommended Fix |
|-----|----------------|
| Root instructions didn't mention plan mode or when to use it | Added ✅ |
| No token economy guidance anywhere | Added to both instruction files ✅ |
| Agent/skill file format not known upfront — required mid-session docs lookup | Add a `## File Format Reference` to root instructions noting `.agent.md` and `SKILL.md` conventions |
| Career instructions had no TDD/validation workflow | Added ✅ |
| No mention of the `recruiter` agent flow (review before sending) | Add to Career instructions: "Always run `recruiter` agent review before marking a resume ready to send" |

---

## Missing Agents → Proposals

| Task Pattern | Proposed Agent |
|-------------|----------------|
| Checking docs / changelog to verify feature availability before implementing | `docs-researcher` skill — fetches and summarises Copilot CLI docs for a given feature |
| Inter-session planning: reviewing what was done, what's next | `session-reviewer` agent (this skill) ✅ |

---

## Missing / Improvable Skills → Proposals

| Repeated Command | Proposed Skill |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Fetching and reading GitHub Copilot CLI documentation URLs | `docs-lookup` skill — given a feature name, fetches the relevant docs.github.com page |
| Reading and summarising `events.jsonl` from a session | `session-review` skill ✅ (created this session) |
| Checking all agents and skills are correctly formatted | `validate-agent-setup` skill — lints `.agent.md` and `SKILL.md` files for required frontmatter |

---

## Hook Opportunities

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `sessionEnd` | Write `Career/CHECKPOINT.md` with completed tasks and next recommended actions |
| `sessionStart` | ✅ Stats dashboard already implemented |
| `userPromptSubmitted` | Detect "pick up" / "continue" / "resume" and auto-read `CHECKPOINT.md` |

---

## Workflow Inefficiencies
- **File format errors caught late**: Agent created agents as `*.md` and skills as flat files.
  Both required fixes after docs lookup. A `validate-agent-setup` skill or pre-flight check
  in the `sessionStart` hook would catch this immediately.
- **Recruiter agent added ad-hoc after plan**: Good responsiveness, but it should have been
  part of the plan — resume review is a natural step in the job search workflow.
- **Status line feature planned but not implemented**: Docs not yet published. The plan
  correctly deferred it, but it should be tracked as a future item.
- **No `sessionEnd` checkpoint yet**: The "pick up where you left off" problem from session 1
  is not yet solved. This session identified the solution but didn't implement it.

---

## Top 3 Actionable Recommendations
1. **Implement `sessionEnd` hook** writing `Career/CHECKPOINT.md` — the single highest-impact
   improvement remaining. Eliminates the need for "pick up where you left off" prompts entirely.
2. **Add `validate-agent-setup` skill** — lints all `.agent.md` files for required fields
   (`name`, `description`, `model`) and `SKILL.md` files for required frontmatter. Catches
   format bugs before they cause silent failures.
3. **Add "review before sending" rule to Career instructions** — "Always use the `recruiter`
   agent to review a resume variant before applying to any role."

## Applied Immediately
- ✅ Session review skill created: `.github/skills/session-review/SKILL.md`
- ✅ Session reviews written for both sessions
- ⏳ `sessionEnd` hook — to be implemented (see recommendations)
- ⏳ `validate-agent-setup` skill — to be implemented
- ⏳ "Review before sending" rule — to be added to Career instructions
