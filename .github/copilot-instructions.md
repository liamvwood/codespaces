# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Repository
Personal workspace for **Liam Wood** — contains independent projects in separate
top-level directories. Each directory may have its own `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
with context specific to that project; read it before working in that directory.

## General Conventions
- Filenames: `snake_case`
- Commit messages: concise imperative summary line, details in body
- Secrets and credentials must never be committed

## Top-Level Directories

| Directory | Purpose | Instructions |
|---|---|---|
| `Career/` | 2026 job search — resumes, cover letters, applications tracker, scraper | `Career/.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
