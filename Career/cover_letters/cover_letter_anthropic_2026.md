[Hiring Manager Name]
Anthropic — Infrastructure Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I own the distributed
event pipeline that processes over 6 billion notifications per month across OneDrive
and SharePoint. I'm reaching out because Anthropic's infrastructure work sits at the
exact intersection I want to move toward: building the data and compute platforms that
make large-scale AI systems possible.

My background maps directly to what your infrastructure team needs. At Microsoft I
designed the full data-flow architecture for a business-critical pipeline — ingest,
processing, fan-out, delivery, and observability — running on AKS with KEDA-driven
autoscaling I built and own. That system cut $500k–$750k in annual compute spend and
runs at 99.99% availability across multiple Azure regions. I also rebuilt CI/CD from
scratch, taking us from 6-week to weekly releases with automated rollback. Before
Microsoft I wrote fault-tolerant state machine components at Visa in C++ and Python,
processing trillions in annual transaction volume with exactly-once guarantees.

What excites me about Anthropic's data infrastructure specifically is the scale and
novelty of the problem: training pipelines, evaluation infrastructure, and the tooling
that lets researchers iterate quickly are all genuinely hard distributed systems
challenges. I want to work on infrastructure where the downstream effect of getting
it right is measurable in model capability — that's a different kind of motivation
than uptime for its own sake.

I'd love to learn more about your team's roadmap. Thank you for your consideration.

Liam Wood
