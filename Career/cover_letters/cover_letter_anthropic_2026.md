[Hiring Manager Name]
Anthropic — Infrastructure Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I own the distributed
notifications pipeline processing over 6 billion events per month across M365, Teams,
Viva, Whiteboard, and SharePoint. I'm reaching out because Anthropic's infrastructure
work sits at the exact intersection I want to move toward: building the data and compute
platforms that make large-scale AI systems possible.

My background maps directly to what your data infrastructure team needs. I've designed
and operated end-to-end event pipelines — ingest, processing, fan-out, delivery, and
observability — on AKS with CPU-based KEDA autoscaling I built and own entirely. That
system cut $750K in annual compute spend and runs at 99.99% availability across every
Azure geo. I migrated the full platform from Azure Cloud Services through Service Fabric
to AKS without a single dropped message. I also rebuilt release pipelines from scratch,
cutting deployment latency from 30+ days to under 10 days. Before Microsoft, I worked
at Visa where I developed a C++ prototype for streaming transactional data from IBM z/OS
mainframes to Linux systems, written to and consumed from Kafka — my first hands-on
work with event-driven data pipelines at scale.

What excites me about Anthropic's data infrastructure specifically is that the downstream
effect of getting it right is measurable in model capability. Training pipelines,
evaluation infrastructure, and the data tooling that lets researchers iterate quickly
are genuinely hard distributed systems problems — harder in many ways than uptime for
its own sake, because correctness and throughput both matter acutely.

I'd love to learn more about your team's roadmap. Thank you for your consideration.

Liam Wood
