[Hiring Manager Name]
Hudson River Trading — Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

Before joining Microsoft I spent two years at Visa writing C++ state-machine
infrastructure that processes trillions of dollars in annual transaction volume.
Working in that environment taught me what it costs to get correctness wrong, and
I've carried that instinct into every system I've built since. It's part of what
draws me to HRT.

At Microsoft I own the distributed notification system that handles 6B+ events per
month across OneDrive and SharePoint — a platform where reliability and efficiency
are operational requirements with direct business consequences. I designed the
multi-region failover architecture, built KEDA-driven autoscaling that eliminated
$500k–$750k in annual waste, and rebuilt CI/CD from the ground up, compressing
release cycles from six weeks to weekly. I've been promoted twice in three years.
My day-to-day stack is C++, Python, and C#/.NET on Linux and AKS — I'm comfortable
at both the systems layer and the infrastructure-as-code layer.

What attracts me to HRT's engineering work is the combination of low-latency
systems depth and the kind of correctness culture that only exists when the cost
of a failure is immediate and measurable. The systems and HPC infrastructure work —
storage, network, distributed compute — is where I want to invest the next phase
of my career.

I'd welcome the chance to talk with your team. Thank you for your time.

Liam Wood
