[Hiring Manager Name]
Eloquent AI — Infrastructure Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I own the distributed
platform processing 6 billion+ events per month across OneDrive and SharePoint.
I'm writing because Eloquent AI is building AI infrastructure for regulated, high-stakes
environments — exactly the intersection of reliability engineering and high-growth
product velocity where I've spent the last three years.

At Microsoft, I've done precisely what this role demands: Terraform-managed
multi-region cluster provisioning, Kubernetes orchestration at scale (KEDA-driven
autoscaling, pod disruption budgets, zero-downtime deployments), and full-stack
observability built around OpenTelemetry, Grafana, and SLOs. I rebuilt CI/CD
end-to-end — reducing release cadence from six weeks to weekly with progressive
rollout and automated rollback. I maintained 99.99% availability for a system
where a missed event has direct product impact, and I've been on-call for it since
day one. Before that I built C++ and Python infrastructure at Visa — systems that
operate under strict compliance and correctness requirements not unlike the financial
services environments Eloquent AI serves.

My infrastructure background is primarily Azure/AKS, but the underlying patterns —
IaC, container orchestration, observability, compliance-aware deployments — are cloud
agnostic, and I've worked with AWS services in a cross-cloud capacity. I move fast,
own outcomes end-to-end, and am most effective in environments where infrastructure
quality has direct product consequences.

I'd love to learn more about the team and the infrastructure challenges you're scaling
through. Thank you for your time.
