[Hiring Manager Name]
Anduril — Backend Core Platform

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer who has spent the last three years as the
sole owner of a distributed system that processes 6 billion events per month at
Microsoft. I built most of it from scratch — the AKS architecture, the KEDA
autoscaling, the CI/CD pipeline, the multi-region failover — and I'm proud that
it runs at 99.99% availability. But I've built it inside one of the largest
technology companies in the world, and I want to see what I can do with the speed
and ownership that only a company like Anduril provides.

My background is exactly what a backend core platform team needs: I'm fluent in
C++, Python, and C#/.NET, comfortable at the Linux systems layer and the
Kubernetes orchestration layer, and I've shipped real infrastructure that people
depend on under production load. Before Microsoft I wrote fault-tolerant settlement
engine components at Visa — C++ and Python systems with trillions of dollars in
annual transaction volume and zero tolerance for dropped records. The discipline
that comes from working in that environment doesn't leave you.

Anduril's core platform work interests me because the autonomy and mission mean
the infrastructure decisions you make have consequences that are both technically
hard and genuinely important. That's the environment where I do my best work —
when ownership is real and the stakes are clear.

I'd love to learn more about your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Liam Wood
