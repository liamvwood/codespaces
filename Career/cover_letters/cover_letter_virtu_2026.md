[Hiring Manager Name]
Virtu Financial — Systems Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft and before that built C++ and
Python settlement infrastructure at Visa — systems that process trillions in annual
transaction volume where correctness is a hard requirement. That combination of
low-latency systems experience and large-scale distributed infrastructure is what
draws me to Virtu's systems engineering work.

At Microsoft I own a distributed platform that handles 6B+ events per month with
99.99% global availability. I designed the multi-region failover, built KEDA-driven
autoscaling that eliminated $500k–$750k in annual compute waste, and rebuilt CI/CD
end-to-end. I'm fluent in C++, Python, and C#/.NET, comfortable at the Linux kernel
and systems layer, and experienced owning the full infrastructure stack —
provisioning, orchestration, observability, and on-call.

What draws me specifically to Virtu is the combination of systems depth and trading
infrastructure: the work of keeping low-latency systems reliable and performant at
scale, with a team that understands exactly why that matters. Austin and New York
are both locations I'm actively targeting.

I'd welcome the chance to speak with your team. Thank you for your time.

Liam Wood
