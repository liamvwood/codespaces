[Hiring Manager Name]
Cloudflare — Distributed Systems Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I own the distributed
notification pipeline that processes 6 billion+ events per month across OneDrive and
SharePoint. I'm writing because Cloudflare's distributed systems work — operating at
global edge scale with the kind of consistency and latency constraints most companies
never encounter — is exactly the environment I want to work in.

At Microsoft I designed and own a multi-region, event-driven platform with 99.99%
availability, built on AKS with KEDA-driven autoscaling (responsible for $500k–$750k
in annual compute savings) and multi-region failover I architected from scratch.
I rebuilt CI/CD end-to-end — from 6-week releases to weekly with progressive rollout
and automated rollback. Before Microsoft I built state-machine components for Visa's
settlement infrastructure in C++ and Python: systems that process trillions of dollars
annually, where exactly-once delivery is the correctness requirement, not a nice-to-have.

What draws me to Cloudflare specifically is the intersection of distributed systems
depth and global reach. Building systems like Unimog, Workers, or the analytical
database platform — where a design decision affects latency for millions of requests
per second across hundreds of edge locations — is a genuinely different class of
engineering problem than most cloud-native work. I want to operate at that level.

I'd love to learn more about your distributed systems engineering role and the team's
current focus. Thank you for your consideration.

Liam Wood
