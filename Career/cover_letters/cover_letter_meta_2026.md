[Hiring Manager Name]
Meta — Infrastructure Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I own the distributed
notification system serving OneDrive and SharePoint at 6 billion events per month with
99.99% global availability. I'm writing because Meta's production engineering and
infrastructure teams work at a scale and reliability bar that I'd be proud to contribute
to — and my background maps directly to the problems you're solving.

At Microsoft I designed multi-region failover using Azure FrontDoor and Traffic Manager,
built KEDA autoscaling that cut annual compute spend by $500k–$750k, and led a full
AKS migration — all while owning on-call for a system that has never been permitted to
go down. I rebuilt our CI/CD pipeline end-to-end, compressing release cycles from six
weeks to weekly with automated progressive rollout and rollback. Before that I wrote C++
and Python infrastructure at Visa for settlement processing — systems with strict
correctness requirements and zero tolerance for data loss.

Meta's network and production engineering work is particularly interesting to me because
of how tightly infrastructure and software intersect at your scale. The tooling,
automation, and systems work required to operate global backbone infrastructure reliably
is exactly the kind of problem I want to spend the next decade on.

I'd welcome the chance to talk with your team. Thank you for your time.

Liam Wood
