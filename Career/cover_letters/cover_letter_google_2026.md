[Hiring Manager Name]
Google — Platforms Infrastructure Engineering

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I own the distributed
notification system that processes over 6 billion events per month across OneDrive and
SharePoint. I'm writing because the Platforms Infrastructure Engineering team at Google
is working on exactly the kind of problems I've built my career around: making compute
and storage infrastructure reliable, efficient, and invisible to the engineers who depend
on it.

At Microsoft, I designed and led the migration to a multi-cluster AKS architecture,
built KEDA-driven autoscaling that cut $500k–$750k in annual compute spend, and drove
release cadence from 6-week cycles to weekly deployments through full CI/CD ownership.
I maintained 99.99% global availability using multi-region failover with automated BCDR.
Before that I spent two years at Visa writing C++ and Python components for a
state-machine–driven settlement engine that processes trillions of dollars annually —
which taught me that at sufficient scale, efficiency and correctness are the same
requirement.

What draws me to Google's infrastructure work specifically is the TPU/GPU platform layer:
the intersection of custom silicon and the software infrastructure that makes it
programmable at scale is one of the hardest and most interesting problems in the field
right now. I'd welcome the opportunity to contribute to it.

Thank you for your time. I'm happy to chat at your convenience.
