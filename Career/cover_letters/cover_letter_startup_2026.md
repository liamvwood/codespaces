[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm an infrastructure engineer who likes to own things end-to-end — the full stack,
from bare metal to deployment pipeline, with nobody else to blame when it breaks. At
Microsoft I'm the sole owner of the notifications infrastructure that powers M365,
Teams, Viva, Whiteboard, and SharePoint — 6B+ events per month, globally deployed to
every geo, one engineer accountable for reliability, cost, delivery, and security.

In three years I've migrated the platform twice — from Azure Cloud Services to Service
Fabric, then to AKS — without dropping a single message. I implemented CPU-based KEDA
autoscaling that cut the compute bill by $750K annually and saved the system during
real traffic-spike incidents. I rebuilt deployments from a slot-based model to in-place
via a custom ADO YAML hotfix pipeline, cutting average deployment latency from 30+ days
to under 10 days while following global safe deployment practices. I designed BCDR
automatic failover using FrontDoor weighted endpoints, migrated our certificates to
autorotation with SNI authentication, and implemented KeyVault-based encryption for
Service Bus messages. I was also the first engineer to ship heuristic-based spam blocks
on our policy engine — blocking tens of millions of spam events with zero impact to live
traffic. I've been promoted year-over-year for it.

Before Microsoft I was at Visa, where I redesigned the settlement management system in
C++ with real-time comms between IBM z/OS mainframes — complete technical ownership,
no oversight. I also built a C++ prototype for streaming mainframe transactional data
to Linux via Kafka, and pioneered git adoption on the mainframe using Broadcom Git Bridge.

[Company] caught my attention because you're building infrastructure where ownership
actually matters. I do my best work in environments that are fast-moving, high-stakes,
and short on people who want to go deep on the hard problems.

I'd love to learn more about the team. Thank you for your time.

Liam Wood
