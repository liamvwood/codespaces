[Hiring Manager Name]
PayPal — Venmo Cloud Infrastructure

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer at Microsoft, where I've spent the last three
years as the technical lead for the distributed notification platform powering OneDrive
and SharePoint — 6 billion+ events per month, dozens of interdependent services, and
one engineer ultimately accountable for reliability, cost, and delivery velocity. I'm
writing because the Sr. Staff Infrastructure role at Venmo is exactly the kind of
cross-team, high-ownership position I've been building toward.

At Microsoft, my scope expanded steadily beyond my own team. I set the infrastructure
conventions for AKS cluster architecture, KEDA-based autoscaling patterns, and
observability standards (OpenTelemetry, SLOs, error budgets) that were adopted across
adjacent platform teams. I drove cost reduction of $500k–$750k annually through
architecture decisions with broad utilization implications — the kind of cross-functional
impact the Sr. Staff role requires. Before Microsoft, I built C++ and Python
infrastructure at Visa that processes trillions in annual payments volume, where
correctness, exactly-once semantics, and fault tolerance are non-negotiable.

What draws me to Venmo specifically is the combination of global payments scale and the
challenge of operating infrastructure that millions of consumers depend on daily. The
work of making cloud infrastructure reliable, efficient, and invisible to the product
teams building on top of it — while influencing architecture across organizational
boundaries — is where I do my best work. Austin is my home base and a long-term target.

I'd welcome the chance to learn more about the team and the infrastructure challenges
you're working through. Thank you for your consideration.

Liam Wood
