[Hiring Manager Name]
[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer with three years at Microsoft owning the distributed
notification system that processes over 6 billion events per month across OneDrive and
SharePoint. I'm writing because [Company]'s infrastructure challenges — operating at
massive scale with high reliability expectations — map directly to the problems I've spent
my career solving.

At Microsoft I've owned the full stack of a business-critical platform: designed and
migrated a multi-cluster AKS architecture, built KEDA-driven autoscaling that cut
$500k–$750k in annual compute spend, and drove our release cadence from 6-week cycles
to weekly deployments through CI/CD ownership and progressive rollout tooling. I
maintained 99.99% availability under continuous global load by designing multi-region
failover with automated BCDR runbooks — and I did most of this with a small team, which
means I know how to move fast without breaking things. I've been promoted twice in three
years for it.

I'd love to bring that same end-to-end ownership to [Company]'s infrastructure team.
I'm happy to chat at your convenience — thank you for your time.

Liam Wood
