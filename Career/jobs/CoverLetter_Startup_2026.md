[Hiring Manager Name]
[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm a platform infrastructure engineer who likes to own things end-to-end. At Microsoft
I've been the sole owner of the distributed notification system powering OneDrive and
SharePoint — 6B+ events per month, dozens of interdependent services, one engineer
responsible for reliability, cost, and delivery. In three years I cut infrastructure spend
by $500k–$750k through KEDA-driven autoscaling, led a full AKS migration, and drove
release cadence from six-week cycles to weekly deployments by rebuilding the CI/CD
pipeline from scratch. I've been promoted twice for it. Before that I built fault-tolerant
settlement engine components at Visa, where the definition of "working software" is
systems that process trillions in transaction volume without a single dropped or
duplicated record.

[Company] caught my attention because you're building infrastructure where ownership
actually matters — where an engineer who cares deeply about reliability, efficiency, and
delivery velocity can have a real impact from day one. That's the environment I do my
best work in. I'm a generalist at the infrastructure layer: comfortable in C++, Python,
and Node.js, at home on Linux and Kubernetes, and opinionated about observability and
on-call culture.

I'd love to learn more about the team and share more about my background. Thank you for
your time.

Liam Wood
