[Company Name]

Dear Hiring Manager,

Before joining Microsoft I spent two years at Visa building state-machine–driven
settlement engine components in Python and C++ — infrastructure that processes trillions
of dollars in annual transaction volume with strict exactly-once correctness guarantees
under concurrent load. Working in that environment taught me what it means to build
systems where a bug is not a pager alert, it's a financial event. That experience is what
draws me to [Company], where correctness and performance are foundational, not
aspirational.

Since then I've scaled those instincts to a different kind of high-stakes system: the
distributed notification infrastructure at Microsoft, processing 6B+ events per month
across OneDrive and SharePoint with 99.99% availability. I designed the multi-region
failover architecture, owned CI/CD from end to end, and led a full AKS migration. I also
built the KEDA-based autoscaling system that eliminated $500k–$750k in annual
over-provisioning — because in infrastructure, efficiency is correctness too.

I'm drawn to [Company]'s engineering culture and would welcome the opportunity to
discuss how my background fits your infrastructure needs. Thank you for your consideration.

Liam Wood
